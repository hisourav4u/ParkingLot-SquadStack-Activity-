## Description

Vehicle.py is a class where I have defined the "Car" vehicle.

ParkingLot.py script defines the following functions -

1. "Create_parking_lot n". 
Create a parking lot of n slots

2.  "Park RegNo driver_age x". 
Park car with vehicle registration number “RegNo”, and the vehicle is driven by the driver of age x

Return slot number for the car with registration number “RegNo”

5. "Leave n". 
Vacate the slot number n from the parking lot, i.e. car which was parked at slot number n has left the space. If there exists no car at slot number n, print “Slot already vacant”

6. "Vehicle_registration_number_for_driver_of_age x". 
Get all parked vehicle registration numbers of cars parked by the driver of age x


ParkingLot.py can be run through shell/cmd or by opening in any python IDE and executing.

You can provide input file (pre-written) during execution through shell/cmd or you can give runtime input.

To run the activity - 

1. Run `python ParkingLot.py`  in shell/cmd to run without any input test case file.
